He knows people will give way when he drives, think twice on their drives, etc. He will only be stopped by a stronger player and/or fearless players like Giannis, Gasol, Draymond, etc. Or by an obviously more skilled player with equal Type A like Ibaka. He didn't intend to injure, but he certainly intends to show you that he doesn't care if you get hurt when he rumbles into you. At least that's how I used to play. But that was streetball.

They are not the same, he‚Äôs out playing Jimmy rn.', 'No not every all time great has had tough paths but it‚Äôs very clear that Jimmy butler was not playing at a level equal to anyone of the players you named. He played a hawks team that had no business being in the playoffs and got in only because of injuries to the Cavs. The 76ers didn‚Äôt have their best player for 2 out of 6 games and was literally at 50%. Their second best player in James harden looks like he‚Äôs again in dog years and that team as a whole has horrible coaching and and no depth. So yes when you play against a dog shit team in the hawks who‚Äôs best player was deandre hunter and a 76ers team who‚Äôs best player that series was a rookie 6‚Äô2 guard your numbers are going to look inflated. You played 2 teams that were horrible defensively in the playoffs and none of their star players showed up\n\nEDIT: he had one game this series where he was good and that was once again where our defensive players didn‚Äôt play and Rob will played on his knee in limited minutes. Ever since we got smart and Horford back he has had mediocre games and been taken out of the game for long stretches. So again I ask, show me where the lie is.', 'Im not trying to argue with you, Im just pointing out the stats. I truly couldnt care less if Butler scored 0 or 100 next game. Is he worse than Tatum this serious? Resounding yes. Was he better than Tatum going into this series? Also, resounding yes. \n\nI like that you conveniently left out MKE losing their second best player, Nets missing Simmons and KD playing like the actual worst super star of the last 10 years lmao. Young at least isnt touted as unguardable.\n\nCheck my post history. I am rooting for the Celtics, and have heaped praise on Tatum, but going into this series he was worse than Butler lmao. Show me where the lie is. Its not like they were even statistically close lol', '‚ÄúIts not like they were even statistically close‚Äù this is where the lie is since you wanted me to point it out btw', 'You better start praying to everything you got young fella. Jimmy has arrived, and played up to those lovely advanced stats I posted that you conveniently ignored lmao', 'Jayson Tatum Vs the nets: 29.5/4.5/7.3/1.8 on 45/41/86\n\nJayson Tatum Vs the bucks: 27.6/6.3/5.4/1.0/1.1 on 42/37/76\n\nJimmy butler Vs the hawks: 30.5/7.8/5.3/2.8 on 54/43/79\n\nJimmy butler Vs the 76ers: 27.5/7.5/5.5/1.7 on 51/32/81\n\nHis only series where he was alittle better than Tatum was the first round and the best player on the hawks was deandre Hunter lmao Tatum had to guard KD/Kyrie. Even without Simmons that nets team is way better than that hawks team. The bucks had the best player in the world and one of the best perimeter defenders of this generation and Tatum still ended up scoring more and having a better series than butler while getting guarded by Giannis and jrue for long stretches and getting blitzed as soon as he crossed the half court line. The heat had a cake walk to the ECF and Jimmy wasn‚Äôt that much better than Tatum outside of the first round. So a ‚Äúresounding yes‚Äù would be a lie. He had the easier schedule and matchups the entire way.', 'This is where I‚Äôd like to point out that those stats easily show Jimmy as the better performer lmao. Jimmy in rounds 1 and 2 was easily the most efficient scorer, while playing elite defense. He was the only player averaging over 25 on 50% or better. 538 had him as equal to Luka in RAPTOR WAR (total impact on a game) and had him slightly lower than Luka in RAPTOR (15.7 to 15.0). Tatum‚Äôs RAPTOR is 2.3 lmao. And his RAPTOR WAR is 1.6 to Jimmy‚Äôs 4.1 lmao. \n\nDont show me these bs counting stats (which Jimmy is still statistically better at lol) without doing some actual digging brother. \n\nIn that game where he was ‚Äògifted‚Äô 20 FT‚Äôs he still had 4 steals and 3 blocks. If we want to break that down, 538 has defensive impact for Butler at 3.7 to Tatum‚Äôs 0.9.\n\nSo thats where your lie is, Jimmy was clear brother. Take the green goggles off. You have him dead to rights this series, but he just simply was better before the series started‚Ä¶\n\nEdit: For context, Jokic‚Äôs RAPTOR rating was 14.9 for the season, and Jimmy was playing above that‚Ä¶', 'Literally just outing yourself as a blind hater lmao', 'I‚Äôm a hater because I‚Äôm speaking truth? The hawks snuck into the playoffs and trae had one of the worst outings by a star in the last 10 years. The 76ers best player was arguably their rookie. James harden played no defense/embiid was gone for 2 games. Both teams played horrible. No star from either team played good at all and neither team played defense. Tell me where the lie is', 'Probably the ""no defense"" part, at a minimum? But I\'m assuming the heat shooting all-time poorly is because of Bostons elite defense right? Y\'all both have only have 1 good each this series, it\'s been garbage outside of that. Before the ECF Jimmy was the best player against NBA playoff teams in the entire league', 'You can go look up the statistics if you‚Äôd like. Boston also has played good defense on the shooters. Oladipo has never been a good shooter so they let him shoot. Struss and Vincent have made very tough looks over good defense. Before the ECF the best player in the playoffs was Giannis or Luka. Just say you follow narrative and don‚Äôt actually watch the games. That‚Äôll make this a lot easier. There‚Äôs no way you watched Luka and Giannis or even Tatum play against better competition and said ‚ÄúJimmy is better than all of them‚Äù. If you did you‚Äôre a liar', 'I mean, his knee is still inflamed. We‚Äôre not sure what kind of impact it‚Äôs had on his game but he hasn‚Äôt moved well at all these past 2 games.', ""And Tatum's shoulder is messed up which is why he was passing the ball a lot more and couldn't get his shot going in the first half. He's still gotta find a way to contribute and get his team going"", 'No one is discrediting that the Celtics aren‚Äôt also hurting but to say that Butler got outplayed by Vincent without recognizing that one is hurt and the other isn‚Äôt is silly. Also, butler aside from fg% had better numbers than Vincent‚Ä¶', 'Your team needed scoring and defense in that 4th quarter. Vincent outscored him and played better defense than he did in that 4th. +/- also doesn‚Äôt like and he was 2nd worst at -15.', 'I mean, the Heat aren‚Äôt my team‚Ä¶.', 'If you‚Äôre playing then you‚Äôre not hurt. It‚Äôs that simple. The heat staff are keeping herro from playing even though herro wants to play. They can do the same for butler if he really is hurt.', 'Speaking of, that guy looked like a real asshole tonight.', 'A groin injury is a lot more serious and can has a higher chance of leading to a worst injury. Look at AD last year. An inflamed knee isn‚Äôt as bad but it doesn‚Äôt mean that it won‚Äôt affect him in game. Just because they can play doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre not hurting.', 'I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that cut and dry because you can definitely play on an injury but I don‚Äôt wanna hear about that injury when the opposite team has 2 players injured. One with the same injury absolutely locking down the 2nd best player on that team and one who has a worse injuries and is moving like he‚Äôs not injured at all. It comes down to want and will. We‚Äôre just out willing and hustling the heat', 'We got smart on a sprained foot and rolled ankle and Rob will with the same injury playing way better than Jimmy. I would give you that if he wasn‚Äôt being outplayed by guys with the same or worse injuries', 'Not even just the best player in the series- Best player in the *playoffs*', 'Wasnt that argumnt made prior to this series? And stats to back it up? But yes this series he got bested. Im more upset at the healthy guys like Bam and Lowry for their lack of scoring. Jimmy has proven he is a baller.', ""Lowry ain't healthy. He's playing on a bad hamstring. Those are nagging injuries that can take weeks or months to feel 100%. And if he overdoes it on the court, he can end up reaggravating the injury and making it worse."", 'That argument was made after the 1st two games of the series as well before he fell off a cliff‚Ä¶', 'He‚Äôs not even the 3rd best player in this series lmao outside of game 1 he‚Äôs been outplayed by Horford lmao', 'All ik is that whoever comes out of this series will be too injured for the Warriors to eat them up', 'Lowry: 25 min 0/1/0/0/0 with 5 fouls + 3 TOs', 'How does a PG get 0 assists', 'Dude had more flops than stats combined', 'Horrendous.. like i would of taken his jersey right there at the game.

A close game between two great teams!""\n\nNah, man. For large stretches, one or both teams were really awful. Butler missed the entire second half. Tatum and Smart missed time with injury. The Boston Celtics somehow forgot how to dribble or pass the ball. Even some of the ""clutch"" shots from Miami were absolutely disaster possessions with terrible shots that somehow went in. It wasn\'t like we were watching fantastic ball.\n\nRooting interest wise, I am pulling for Miami and Dallas in their respective series.\n\nIf those two teams face off though, we could be looking at some mid-to-late-90s-level of slow, boring basketball that no one would watch if it weren\'t the Finals (think the Bulls/Jazz Finals or pretty much any EC series.)', 'I miss bucks game threads already :(', ""Wasn't able to watch.

When he's bad, he's just really bad. I'd have to assume it's a mental thing (mentally checks out if he's struggling early.) But, it seems like there's rarely middle ground. Either All-NBA or terrible.\n\nFinally, Boston played an all-time awful game (I think I read or saw Miami had the second most steals ever in a playoff game.) Some were caused due to great defense, but also just a lot of sloppy basketball.\n\nAgain, as someone rooting for the Heat, I came away from last night's game more convinced Boston was winning the series than I was going into the series.

I'm not about to crucify Tatum, but that man had no business coming back into the game as well. Superstars don't stop shooting. He's also not a solid facilitator.
